<h1>Bentley Family Genealogy</h1>

<p>
My ninth‐great‐grandfather was William Bentley,
the first of my line to come to the Americas.
He sailed from England and arrived in Virginia in the early 17th century.
</p>

<p>
William, in turn,
was a distant descendant of Drew of Bentley, the first to take surname.
Drew was granted land—Bentley Haye—from William the Conqueror,
and took his name from the land.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>

<p>
Here I plan to collect various family history resources as I come across them.

<dd>A work describing the history of the Bentley family in Ohio. Not closely
related to me, but we do probably share ancestry with William.</dd>

The earliest source that I can find for the story of Drew of Bentley is a <a href="https://familysearch.org/films/lookup/product/view/?id=1&amp;film=1033570">
1980 manuscript by Eleanor Trismen</a>,
which makes reference to another genealogical manuscript by 19th century
lawyer George F. Bentley.
</p>
<p>I have been unable to find George F. Bentley’s manuscript.
