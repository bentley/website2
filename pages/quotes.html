By their fruits you will know them.
Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
Even so, every good tree produces good fruit;
but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.

…Plato saw [Diogenes of Sinope] washing lettuces,
came up to him and quietly said to him,
<q>Had you paid court to Dionysius, you wouldn’t now be washing lettuces.</q>
… [Diogenes] with equal calmness made answer,
<q>If you had washed lettuces, you wouldn’t have paid court to Dionysius.</q>

<blockquote>
<p>
Some man comes along with an invention and parades it in the streets;
and we are told that, in consequence of this act on his part, we must
either give up our liberty to walk the streets or else our liberty to
invent the thing that he has invented! Not so fast, my dear sir. …
Were you compelled to parade your invention through the streets? Were
you even invited to do so? No! Then why do you do it? And why do you
ask us to protect you from the consequences? You want your invention
to yourself? Then keep it to yourself. Nobody says you nay. But when
you parade it in the streets, you voluntarily abandon your liberty to
keep it to yourself. And if you, denying this, ask us to aid you in
depriving us of our birthright in the facts and truths of nature, we
admire your assurance, but we do not bow to your will.

<p>
An Act for establishing religious Freedom.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Whereas, Almighty God hath created the mind free;</p></li>
<li><p>That all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens,
or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness,
and therefore are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion,
who being Lord, both of body and mind yet chose not to propagate it by
coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do,</p></li>
<li><p>That the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as
ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men have
assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and
modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavouring to
impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over
the greatest part of the world and through all time;</p></li>
<li><p>That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical;</p></li>
<li><p>That even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own
religious persuasion is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his
contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his
pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is
withdrawing from the Ministry those temporary rewards, which, proceeding from
an approbation of their personal conduct are an additional incitement to
earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind;</p></li>
<li><p>That our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any
more than our opinions in physics or geometry,</p></li>
<li><p>That therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public
confidence, by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of
trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious
opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages, to
which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a natural right,</p></li>
<li><p>That it tends only to corrupt the principles of that very Religion it is
meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and
emoluments those who will externally profess and conform to it;</p></li>
<li><p>That though indeed, these are criminal who do not withstand such
temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way;</p></li>
<li><p>That to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field
of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on
supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous fallacy which at once
destroys all religious liberty because he being of course judge of that
tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment and approve or condemn
the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own;</p></li>
<li><p>That it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for
its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against
peace and good order;</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, that Truth is great, and will prevail if left to herself,
that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to
fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural
weapons free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is
permitted freely to contradict them:</p></li>
<li><p>Be it enacted by General Assembly that no man shall be compelled to
frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever,
nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods,
nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief,
but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their
opinions in matters of Religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish,
enlarge or affect their civil capacities.
And though we well know that this Assembly elected by the people for the
ordinary purposes of Legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of
succeeding Assemblies constituted with powers equal to our own, and that
therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we
are free to declare, and do declare that the rights hereby asserted, are of
the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed
to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an
infringement of natural right.</p></li>
