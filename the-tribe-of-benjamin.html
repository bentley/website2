<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>My interest in the Bentley family arises from the fact that
my wife is a Bentley, which brought me into acquaintance,
many years ago, with her grandfather General Robert Bentley,
and several of his brothers, all of whom were early pioneers in
eastern Ohio.

<p>They were superior men in many ways, and later on when
I became interested in the genealogy of my own family, it
occurred to me that the Bentleys also were well worthy of
record, and so, as opportunities offered, I gathered up the threads
of Bentley history, and now at last I have put them into shape
for preservation.

<p>It is a mere outline, at best, of Ohio Bentleys, but back of
them I have referred to collateral lines in only a few instances,
and have simply followed the lineal ancestors of the tribe of
Benjamin back to William the first, of whom we have record as
early as 1679, in the colony of Rhode Island, where all the
Bentleys in America, whose ancestry antedates the revolutionary
war, had their origin.

<p>Of these Bentleys there are now several thousand of the
name and blood, and no family in America has a more honorable
record and its history ought to be completed. With the genealogical
tree fully outlined it is now comparatively easy to locate
the different branches, if they can be brought together, and it is
to be hoped that some one of the name will be found with the
leisure and patriotism to accomplish that result.

<p>Solomon has declared that <q>a good name is rather to be
chosen than great riches,</q> but a good name, if it is to be of
practical value, must be established and made known.

<p>Doubtless errors will be found in the statements I have
made, and important additions may be suggested, and if so I
would be glad to hear from anyone who can furnish authentic
information.

<p>R. BRINKERHOFF.
Mansfield, Ohio, 1897.

<h2>The Bentley Family.</h2>

<p>As early as 1679 we know that there was a William Bentley
who resided in Kings Town, Rhode Island, for history shows
that he with 41 others of Narragansett, sent a petition to the
King praying that <q>he would put an end to these differences
about the government thereof, which hath been so fatal to the
prosperity of the place; animosities still arising in the people’s
minds, as they stand affected to this or that government.</q>

<p>William Bentley was a currier by trade, and his name appears
upon the town record in various transactions. In 1687,
Sept. 6, he was taxed 4s. 6½d. In 1705 he had liberty granted
by the town to set up a house, convenient for carrying on of his
currying trade. In 1712, Jan. 30, he deeded to his son James
128 acres. In 1715, Nov. 1, he deeded to his son Thomas 11
acres recently bought of widow Weathers and her son. In 1720
he died and his wife Sarah and son Benjamin were appointed
executors under his will. There were bequests to his eldest son
William, and also to sons James, and Thomas, and Benjamin,
and to his daughter Jane Whitmore.

<p>So far as known all the Bentleys in America, who date back
their ancestry to a period prior to the Revolutionary War, are
descendents of William Bentley, Sr., of Rhode Island. Possibly
he may have had brothers, but we have no certain record of
them. However there are some traditions that are worthy of
consideration, in which it is claimed that there were two or three
brothers.

<p>John D. Bentley, of Corry, Pa., writes: <q>My father and a
son now living in Boston, both of whom were at some expense
and travel in tracing the name back, claimed that there were
three Bentleys, who came from England, one settling in Rhode
Island, one in Berlin, Rensselaer County, New York, and one
was an officer in command of an English regiment, which was
quartered in eastern New York and who returned to England.
The brother who settled in Berlin built the first grist and saw
mill in Rensselaer County, and was named Philip Bentley.</q>

<p>Still another tradition from Mrs. Lavinia Bentley Jones,
who resides upon the old homestead of her father, Sheshbazzar
Bentley, Jr., near Bentleyville, Washington County, Pa., is,
<q>that during the colonial period one George Bentley was drafted
into the English service and came to America as a member of
the Royal troops. Sometime after the war closed he located
permanently in Chester County, Pa., where he married Jane
Carson, a native of Ireland. To them a large family was born,
of whom Sheshbazzar Bentley, my grandfather was the oldest.</q>

<p>There is still another tradition which comes from E. T.
Bentley of Ithaca, N. Y., who says: <q>About 1716 three brothers
John, William and Joseph Bentley came from Scotland and
settled in Rhode Island. Joseph soon became homesick and
returned to Scotland. When the boundary line was run between
Rhode Island and Connecticut, it brought William into Connecticut.
Both married and had large families. John was a large
man with black hair and eyes. Williain had sandy hair and
blue eyes. My grandfather was a son of William and now down
to the fifth and sixth generation the red hair crops out, though
there were none of my fathers family — fifteen in number — who
had red hair; but many of his grandchildren and great‐grandchildren
show the red hair. John’s family nearly all had black
hair and eyes, and this is peculiar to them until the present time.
My grandfather, Greene, (son of William) was born in Connecticut
about 1730 (really March 23, 1741.) At the outbreak
of the Revolutionary War he enlisted and served seven years,
and died in Chemung County, N. Y., 1830. My father Benjamin was
born in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1772 and died at
Tioga, Pa., 1854. Some of John Bentley’s family settled in
Jefferson County, N. Y., and some in Chemung. They were
nearly all Baptists, and my grandfather was driven out of
Connecticut because he would not pay tithes to the Church of England.</q>

<p>This tradition may be true but my impression is that the
John Bentley mentioned was the oldest son of William Bentley,
Jr., and the half‐brother of Greene Bentley, as will appear
farther on in the family record of William Bentley, Jr., of R. I.
All of the traditions given have a family resemblance and may
be based upon the substantial fact that there were two brothers
and that John Bentley was the brother of Wm. Bentley, Sr., of
Rhode Island. Greene Bentley, however, was evidently the son
of Wm. Bentley, Jr., of Rhode Island, as his name appears in
the chart of Rhode Island Bentleys, printed as an appendix to
this pamphlet.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>

<p>There is still another tradition given by Aholiab Bentley in
a letter written in 1884, in which he said: <q>I have heard by
some one, but I have forgotten by whom, that originally four
brothers came from England to America, one settling in Pennsylvania,
one in Virginia, one in New England, and the other
in New York. I was acquainted with some of the name from
Virginia, and years ago in traveling in Indiana the landlord,
where the stage stopped for supper, was a Bentley, and he informed me
he was from the state of New York, and that his
name was George.</q>

<p>The Indiana man was doubtless a descendant of one of the
Rhode Island Bentleys, already noted as coming to New York,
and the presumption is that the other three brothers were of the
same Rhode Island origin.

<p>The Bentleys in America of Rhode Island origin prior to
the Revolution—and apparently there are no others—are largely
Baptists in religious faith, and among them baptist ministers are
numerous.

<p>For a century after the settlement of Rhode Island by Roger
Williams, in 1636, there was no other colony where a conscientious
Baptist (and all pioneer Bentleys were such) could have
found a church home, and even down to the Revolution there
was no other community where they would have received toleration
or welcome, except among the tolerant Dutchmen on the
Hudson river, or among the Quakers of Pennsylvania, and therefore
all presumptions are in favor of Rhode Island as the starting
point of the Bentleys of that period.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>

<p>Among the Bentleys, down to the present, scripture names
have been largely in the ascendant.

<p>John D. Bentley of Corry, Pa., writes: <q>The old stock
partook of the times in which they were reared, and with a devotion
that seems merciless they tortured their children with
scripture names, no doubt thinking to obtain Divine favor in so
doing. My grandfather, after exhausting the scriptures in selecting
names for his children, had the cruelty to name a girl
Zipporah. My grandfather was Noah Bentley of Stephentown,
Rensselaer County, N. Y. He was a Baptist minister and had
three wives by whom he had 23 children, 14 boys and 9 girls.
His family finally became too numerous for the Church to support,
when he took up and became the owner of 500 acres of
land, and raised 23 of his children.</q>

<p>The Bentleys have largely been farmers, but of these many,
all along the line, have also been millers and millwrights.

<p>John D. Bentley says: <q>While the Bentley name occupies
no place of distinction in the history of the country, I have met
some very able men of that name as lawyers, judges, doctors,
musicians, merchants and mechanicps. I met a gentleman of that
name in Titusville a short time since, who stated that he had
made extensive inquiries about the family and that he had never
heard of one who was a public charge as a pauper, or died a
drunkard, or had been in prison as a convicted criminal, and my
own experience confirms the truth of this statement.</q>

<p>In these conclusions Ohio Bentleys fully concur, except as
to the practice of conferring scripture names upon their children,
which they still believe in as preferable to those of the heroes of
modern fiction, or the celebrities of pagan history.<sup id="ref3"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>

<h2>The Tribe of Benjamin.</h2>

<p>As this monograph is confined mainly to the descendants of
Benjamin Bentley, of whom we first have record as a resident in
Chester County, Pennsylvania, and who is the common ancestor
of nearly all of the Ohio Bentleys, we will only make brief mention
of those who preceded him. His father was George Bentley, the
second son of William Bentley, Jr., who was the oldest
son of William and Sarah Bentley, the original settlers in Rhode
Island, from England and Scotland.

<h3>William the First.</h3>

<p>William Bentley, Sr., the first of the Bentley name of
whom we have any knowledge in America, settled in Kings
Town, Rhode Island, prior to 1679, but how much earlier we do
not know. His wife’s name was Sarah, and they died in 1720,
leaving five children, viz: William Jr., James, Thomas, Benjamin,
and Jane. William, Jr., was twice married and left 13
children, 9 sons and 4 daughters. James was twice married,
and left two daughters. Thomas was married but left no
children. Benjamin left one son, who may have had descendants,
but so far as we have any knowledge, all the descendants
of William Bentley, Sr., of the Bentley name, are from William
Bentley, Jr.

<h3>William the Second.</h3>

<p>William Bentley, Jr., was twice married, first April 21,
1703, to Mary Elliot; and second to Bathsheba Lewis, Aug. 1,
1734. He had 13 children, 8 by the first marriage, and 5 by
the second, as follows: Third Generation — 1. John, 2.
George, 3. Caleb, 4. Ezekiel, 5. Tabitha, 7. Ruhama, 8. Mary,
9. William, born May 29, 1735, 10. Thomas, 11. James, born
June 6, 1739, 12. Greene, born March 23, 1741, 13. Benjamin,
born June 11, 1744.

<p>George Bentley, the second son of William Bentley, Jr.,
came to Chester County, Pennsylvania, sometime before the war
of the Revolution, but how long before we do not know. Tradition
says that he married Jane Carson, a lady from Ireland.
They raised a family of eight children, six sons and two
daughters, viz: Fourth Generation — 1. Sheshbazzar, 2. House, 3.
Jeffrey, 4. Absolom, 5. Mary, born Dec. 15, 1754, 6. Benjamin,
born Aug. 14, 1757, 7. Margaret, born Dec. 2, 1759, 8. Joseph.

<p>About the time of the Revolutionary War, George Bentley
removed with his family to western Pennsylvania, and settled at
Jacob’s Creek, in Westmorland County, (then a wilderness)
where he remained until 1787, and then removed to a tract of
land lying on the west bank of the Monongahela river in Washington
County, Pa., where he died. We know from the records
of deeds in Washington County, that his oldest son Sheshbazzar,
by deed dated May 8, 1777, purchased a tract of land of 1,050
acres, situated and lying on Pigeon Creek, for which he paid
400 pounds. To this he afterwards added 297 acres at the mouth
of Mingo Creek.

<p>The records also show that House Bentley, the brother of
Sheshbazzar, bought 413 acres adjoining his brother, for which
he obtained title by deed dated Aug. 19, 1794.

<p>Joseph, the youngest brother, remained with his father until
his death, and inherited his entire estate in Washington County.

<p>Sheshbazzar, the oldest brother, was born in Chester County,
Pa., where he learned the trade of millwright which he
subsequently followed. Upon his removal to Washington County,
he built and operated the first mill on Pigeon Creek. The first
election in his district was held in his house in 1787. In religious
faith he was a member of the Society of Friends. The village
of Bentleyville, near his residence was named after him. He
died in 1800 and was buried upon his own land, in a spot
selected by him, which still remains the family burying‐ground.
Sheshbazzar Bentley married Hannah Baldwin, a widow, by
whom he had six children, viz: House, George, Benjamin,
Hannah, Jane, and Sheshbazzar, Jr. All these children married
and left families except George, who left no heirs. Of these
children Sheshbazzar, Jr., remained on the old homestead, where
he was twice married and raised a family of 13 children, 5 sons
and 8 daughters. One of these daughters married Mr. J. W.
Stephenson from whom, a dozen years ago, I received nearly all
the information I have given in regard to the Bentleys of
Western Pennsylvania. One of the daughters is Lavinia Bentley
Jones, wife of Rev. J. P. Jones, who inherited the old
homestead and still resides upon it.

<p>House Bentley, the brother of Sheshbazzar, Sr., also married
and left a family in Washington County. Of the other two
brothers, Jeffrey and Absolom, we have no information. The
oldest sister Mary, was born Dec. 15, 1754, and died Dec. 20,
1830. She married John Worth of Chester County, Pa. They
raised a family of 8 children, all sons except one, and all left
children, and many of their descendants still remain in eastern
Pennsylvania. Among them is Bentley Worth of West Chester,
Pa., now 77 years old (1897) who is a grandson of Mary, and to
whom I am indebted for valuable information.

<p>Margaret, the youngest daughter of George was born Dec.
2, 1759, and died Nov. 26, 1849, at Mt. Vernon, O. She
married Hugh Newell of Washington County, Pa. She had
11 children, 6 sons and 5 daughters. Of these daughters, Mary
Bentley Newell, married James McGibeny, and one of their sons,
John Newell McGibeny, married Mary Lyon Huston, and one of
their daughters, Harriett McGibney, married Alfred Z. Anderson
and resides at Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Anderson has taken
special interest in Bentley genealogy, and has given valuable
assistance in its compilation. She has 4 sons, Ralph, Harold,
Dwight, and Paul.

<p>Mrs. H. E. Brown of Findlay, Ohio, is also a granddaughter of Mary
Bentley Newell.

<p>Joseph Bentley, the youngest son of George, married Lucy
Dailey, by whom he had seven children, six sons and a daughter.


<h3>Benjamin Bentley.</h3>

<p>Benjamin Bentley, the sixth child of George, apparently
did not go with the other brothers to Washington County, or at
least did not settle there. At any rate we find him in 1810
with his family in Mercer County, Pa., near where Sharon now
stands, and from there he moved to the adjoining County of
Trumbull in Ohio, where he located upon a farm, and remained
there until his death Sept. 23, 1818. By trade he was a
millwright. Benjamin Bentley married Mary Baldwin, daughter of
his brother Sheshbazzar’s wife, who was a widow Baldwin. By
her he had 13 children all of whom grew to maturity, married
and raised families except one daughter, Mary, who was drowned
at the age of 8 years. They were as follows: Fifth Generation —
1. Robert, born Sept. 30, 1783, died May 5, 1862; 2.
Adamson, born July 4, 1785, died Nov. 1864; 3. Elizabeth, born
July 12, 1787; 4. George, born June 28, 1790, died Oct, 7, 1865;
5. Hannah, born Nov. 27, 1792, died May 5, 1856; 6. Benjamin,
born April 6, 1796, died Oct. 22, 1880; 7. James, born May 23,
1798, died May 14, 1890; 8. Martin, born May 25, 1800, died
May 14, 1834; 9. Sheshbazzar, March 12, 1803, died July 13,
1877; 10. Mary, born May 17, 1805, died Feb. 13, 1813; 11.
Aholiab, born May 22, 1807, died Dec. 26, 1891.

<p>The sons of Benjamin, and there were 8 of them, were large,
fine‐looking and healthy men, and all were tall men except Robert
and Martin. Adamson was near six feet four inches tall, and
all lived beyond three score years and ten, except Martin who
died at 34. They were all men of ability above the average, and
all were worthy and useful citizens, and men of influence in the
communities where they lived.

<h3>Robert Bentley.</h3>

<p>Robert Bentley, oldest son of Benjamin, was born in
Pennsylvania and came with his father to Trumbull County, Ohio,
where his early life was spent, and where he married Phebe
Lake, daughter of Constance Lake. In 1815 he removed to
Mifflin Township, Richland County, Ohio, where, with his
family he camped about a week upon the south‐west quarter of
Section 10, while he was building his cabin. He brought with
him two yoke of oxen, two horses ahead of them, two sows,
two calves, and a fine mare, upon which Mrs. Bentley rode with
her child Mary, who subsequently became the wife of Dr. William
Bushnell. The only road through the township was the
State road from Wooster through Mansfield to Bucyrus, a mere
trail sufficient for the passage of a wagon. After living in his
log house for a time he built near by the first brick dwelling
house in Richland County. Some years later he removed to
Washington Township and erected a flouring mill which he
operated for many years. In 1839 he removed to Mansfield
where he resided until his death in 1862. He was a man of mark
in his day and filled various important offices. In 1821 he was
appointed Associate Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and
served 7 years. In 1828 he was elected to the State Legisture
(House of Representatives) and was re‐elected in 1830, serving
in that capacity four years. He was for some time connected
with the military service, rose to the rank of Major General of
the militia. In the war of 1812 he was an officer of the militia,
and was called out after Hull’s surrender, and participated in
whatever service the Ohio troops rendered at that time. In
person he was the shortest of all the brothers, but still he was a
man of medium height, strong and athletic, and died of old age,
rather than by disease. Like his ancestors he was a loyal
Baptist and when he came to Mansfield was the founder of the
Baptist Church, and to the end was one of its main supporters
and worthy members. He had but two children who grew up
to maturity. The oldest, Baldwin, born June 21, 1810, was
one of the early merchants and successful business men of
Mansfield. February 29, 1832, he married Anna Maria, daughter of
Henry Arnold of Lancaster County, Ohio, and died at the early
age of 26, leaving two children, the eldest of whom, Mary,
married General Roeliff Brinkerhoff and still resides with her family
in Mansfield, Ohio.<sup id="ref4"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>

<p>The youngest named Robert Henry, now General Robert
H. Bentley, is a fanner and resides on the old homestead in
Washington Township, Richland County, Ohio. His record as
a soldier is given in Whitelaw Reid’s "Ohio in the War" Vol.
I, page 959, and that of Gen’l Brinkerhoff on page 960.

<p>The second child of Robert was named Mary, and she
married Dr. Wm. Bushnell, one of the pioneer physicians of the
county, and for over sixty years its best known practitioner. They
had five children, only one of whom survived, viz: Martin
Baldwin Bushnell, who still resides in Mansfield and is one of
its leading citizens.<sup id="ref5"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup>

<h3>Adamson Bentley.</h3>

<p>Adamson Bentley, second son of Benjamin, was born in
Allegheny County, Pa., July 4, 1785, and at an early age came
to Brookfield, Trumbull County, Ohio. He began life at 19
years of age as a Baptist preacher, and was settled as a pastor in
Warren, the county seat of Trumbull County, in 1810. In addition
to his work in the ministry he was a merchant, a cattle
drover and also managed a tavern. He was a director in the
Western Reserve Bank, and built a number of houses. About
1820 he became interested in the doctrine advanced by Alexander
Campbell, and eventually became one of his followers. He
died in November, 1S64.

<p>In “The Historical Collections of the Mahoning Valley” it
is stated (page 207) <q>in 1810, May 19, Adamson Bentley, a man
of great worth and no small celebrity, took charge of the
congregation of the First Baptist Church in Warren, and a year later
became the established pastor. The church increased under his
ministrations, and the house of worship now occupied by the
Disciples, north of the Public Square, was built in 1821–23. It
is therefore the oldest building for public worship in Warren.</q>

<p>Adamson Bentley married Mary Brooks of Warren, Ohio.
They had nine children, viz: Lorinda, Stoughton, Mary, Benjamin,
Martha, Martin, Laura, Lucretia and Emily, all of whom
are now deceased except Martha and Emily who reside at
Chagrin Falls, and Martin who resides in Chicago. Stoughton
was a merchant at Birmingham Ohio, and his son Charles
Stoughton, is a lawyer in Cleveland, Ohio, and has been a Common
Pleas Judge. Benjamin Bentley was a merchant in Philadelphia where
his family still resides.

<h3>Elizabeth Bentley.</h3>

<p>Elizabeth Bentley, eldest daughter of Benjamin, was born
July 12, 1787. She married William Marford and left children,
of whom none are now living.

<h3>George Bentley.</h3>

<p>George Bentley, fourth son of Benjamin, was born in
Washington County, Pa., June 28, 1790. In the year 1798 the
family removed to Mercer County, Pa., and later on, about the
year 1811, he with some other members of the family, acquired
a tract of land in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he built a grist
mill, and later on a saw mill and oil mill. In the War of 1812
he was an officer in the Ohio militia, and was called out at the
time of Hull’s surrender. In the year 1812 he married Jane
Wheeler, a daughter of Simon Wheeler, who, as a soldier of the
Revolution from Connecticut, had received a grant of land upon
the Western Reserve. They had eight children, viz: Adamson,
Saloma, Wheeler, Lucy Ann, George J., Benjamin, Condace
and Ambrose Dudley, all of whom were born in Trumbull Co.
In 1836 he removed with his family to LaPorte County, Ind.,
where he remained until his death in 1865. Like his brother
Adamson he adopted in early life the teachings of Alexander
Campbell, whose followers are now known as Christians, and
was a faithful member of that church until he died.

<p>Of his children only three are now living. One, Ambrose
Dudley Bentley, is a farmer on the old homestead near
Waterford, LaPorte County, Ind. Another, George Judson Bentley,
is a leading physician in San Jose, California, where he has
resided since 1875, and is still active in his profession at the age
of 75. The third, Mrs. Lucy Bentley Hagerman, resides in Jackson, Mich.

<p>Dr. Bentley was born Sept. 16, 1823, in Brookfield, Trumbull
County, Ohio, and removed with his father to Indiana in
1836. There he managed to get a liberal education, and then
learned the trade of a millwright and worked at it until he
accumulated a thousand dollars. He then studied medicine and
graduated at the Rush Medical College in 1852. In 1853 he
married Julia Ann Parker, and practiced medicine in Michigan
City until 1862, when he went into the army as a surgeon. On
his return in 1864 he was appointed by Governor Morton as
physician and surgeon at the Northern Prison, Michigan City,
and held that position for six years. In 1875 he removed to
his present location in California.

<h3>Hannah Bentley.</h3>

<p>Hannah Bentley, the fifth child of Benjamin, was born
November 27, 1792, and died May 5, 1856. She was twice
married, first to Henry Newkirk, by whom she had three children,
two sons and a daughter, then to Wm. Shepherd by whom she
had a son and a daughter. Of these children only one is now
living, Cyrus Newkirk, who resides at Del Rosa, in Los Angeles
County, Cal. He formerly resided in Sedalia, Missouri, where
he was president of a National Bank.

<h3>Benjamin Bentley.</h3>

<p>Benjamin, the sixth child of Benjamin, was born April 6,
1796, and died in the state of Tennessee Oct. 22, 1880. He was
a man of ability, and of fine presence and manners, so that he
was called “the gentleman” of the family. In the early days he
was a merchant and banker in Wooster, Ohio, but meeting with
reverses he removed with his family to eastern Tennessee, where
he established a sheep and fruit farm. In 1823 he married Mary
Stewart. They had four children, viz: Benjamin Franklin,
Mary Stewart, William, and Flora, all of whom are now dead
except Mary Stewart, who is the wife of Hon. Jas. W. Allen,
an old resident and leading citizen of Nashville, Tennessee.

<h3>James Bentley.</h3>

<p>James Bentley, the seventh son of Benjamin and Mary Baldwin
Bentley, was born May 22, 1798. His parents came from
Baldwin Township, Washington Co., now a part of Allegheny
County, Pa., in 1796 to Sharon, Pa. In 1806 they moved 1½
miles west of Sharon into Brookfield, Ohio, on the farm where
James Bentley lived until his death, with the exception of about
two years when he clerked for his brother in a store at Warren.
February 22, 1822, he was married to Temperance Buttles of
Granby, Connecticut, with whom he lived 65 years, when Mrs.
Bentley died. Mr. Bentley was the father of seven children.
Amos Baldwin, who is a lawyer at Ravenwood, Missouri, Anson
G., Caroline, Eveline, Martin, Benjamin and Joel Buttles. Mr.
Bentley was a farmer by occupation, though for many years he
owned and operated a saw mill in connection with his farm
work. The mill was propelled by water power and situated on
the Big Yankee Creek which runs through the farm. Physically
Mr. Bentley was a little above medium hight with great
constitutional vigor and vitality. Politically Mr. Bentley was
a Democrat. His first presidential vote was cast for James Monroe’s
second term (1820), his last one for Grover Cleveland. He
claimed to have voted at every National, State and County election
held in Brookfield since the Monroe campaign until 1890.
He never sought notoriety or office, but when chosen by the
people he served two terms as Justice of the Peace, and in 1840,
before Mahoning County was formed, he was one of the marshals
who took the census of the south half of Trumbull County. He
never united with any church or any order except the Masonic,
which he joined in 1819 and continued a member until his death
which took place May 14, 1890, having been a member of that
order for 71 years.<sup id="ref6"><a href="#note6">6</a></sup>


<h3>Martin Bentley.</h3>

<p>Martin, the eighth child of Benjamin, was born May 25,
1800, and died May 14, 1834. He was a business man of marked
ability. For a time he resided in Warren, Ohio, where he was
treasurer of Trumbull County and Cashier of the Western
Reserve Bank. From Warren he removed to Norwalk, Ohio,
where he organized the first National Bank of which he became
president, and retained that position until he died. In 1823 he
married Elizabeth Fitch of New York City, and left one child,
Martin Bentley, Jr. Mrs. Bentley survived her husband many
years and died in 1869.<sup id="ref7"><a href="#note7">7</a></sup>

<h3>Sheshbazzar Bentley.</h3>

<p>Sheshbazzar, the ninth child of Benjamin, was born March
12, 1S03, and died July 13, 1877.

<p>This scripture name is found in the book of Ezra, chapt. 1,
verse 8, where it is recorded that Cyrus, King of Persia, delivered
<q>the vessels taken by Nebuchadnezzar from the house of the
Lord, unto Sheshbazzar, the Prince of Judah</q>.

<p>He was a very superior man in many ways. He was brought
up on a farm, but acquired an excellent education. In early
manhood he went to Wooster, Ohio, where he married Louise
Jeffries, and where for a time he was connected with a bank.

<p>The bank having failed, he removed in 1849, to southern
Ohio, in Gallia County, where he went into the manufacture of
pig iron. About that time a tariff bill was passed by congress
putting a high duty upon iron, which made the iron business
very profitable, so that in a few years Mr. Bentley retired with
an ample fortune and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he
resided until he died.

<p>In later years he travelled widely, in America and in Europe, and
was a man of large and varied information. From
early manhood he was a devoted and zealous member of the
church of “The Desciples of Christ,” and his daily life was a
proof of the sincerity of his convictions.

<p>He had four children, only two of whom grew to maturity.
Amanda, who married John Bishop, of Cincinnati, and now resides in
New York City, although in recent years she has spent
a good deal of time in Europe. Lillie, who married Harry Bowen
of Cincinnati, and who for several years past, since the death of
her husband, has resided in Paris, France, for the education of
her two daughters.

<h3>Mary Bentley.</h3>

<p>Mary, the tenth child and youngest daughter of Benjamin,
was born May 17, 1805, and was accidently drowned Feb. 13,
1813.

<h3>Aholiab Bentley.</h3>

<p>Aholiab Bentley, (Exodus 31:6) the youngest of the family,
was born May 22, 1807, near Sharon, Mercer County, Pa., and
died at Portsmouth, Ohio, December 26, 1891.

<p>When a year old he removed with the family to Trumbull
County, Ohio, His education was of the kind afforded by the
common schools of the day, but his experiences in the pioneer
times was a mine of education which he worked to the fullest
capacity. At the age of 20 he taught school in Warren County,
Ohio, and then for a time he was a merchant in Youngstown.
In 1846 he established an iron furnace in Gallia County, Ohio,
known as Gallia Furnace, which he operated for eleven year.
He was also interested in the Eagle Furnace. Having acquired
a comfortable fortune, he removed in 1853 to Portsmouth, where
he resided during the remainder of his life. Here he held prominent
positions in business and social circles, being a member of
the city council for some time, and occupying other positions of
public trust.

<p>He was twice married, first in 1830 to Mrs. Mary Ann
Dennis McCalla, of Brown County, who died April 8, 1836.
By this marriage there were two children: Morrison, who (1897)
is a farmer and real estate agent at Salem, Oregon, and Martin
Corwin, who was accidently killed in 1854 at the age of 21
years. The second marriage was in 1840 with Jane Linn,
daughter of Ebenezer Linn of Brown County, Ohio, and to them
five children were born. Laura Jane and Mary Ellen, who married
brothers, C. P. and R. M. Lloyd. Both are now widows
and reside with their children in Portsmouth, Ohio. Linn Bentley,
the oldest son, like his father is an iron manufacturer and
resides with his family in Columbus, Ohio. The son, Benjamin,
resides at Jackson, Ohio, and Franklin died in infancy.

<p>Aholiab Bentley was identified with the Methodist Church
for over 50 years and held various positions of honor and trust in
the 6th Street Methodist Church of Portsmouth, Ohio.

<p>He was a man of sterling integrity and left to his children
the priceless heritage of an unblemished name. So with all the
Bentleys as far as known, a good name has been their continuous
inheritance.

<blockquote>
<p><q>Of six preceding ancestors, that gem<br>
Conferred by testament to the sequent issue,<br>
Hath it been owned and worn.<br>
It is an honor belonging to our house,<br>
Bequeathed down from many ancestors.<br>
Which were the greatest obloquy in the world<br>
In me to lose.</q>

<p>—Shakespeare.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="note1"><p>
The facts I have given in regard to Greene and John Bentley were obtained
from E. T. Bentley of Ithaca, N. Y., (now deceased) with whom I had
correspondence in 1885. In addition he said that his grandfather, Greene
Bentley, married Dianah Greene about 1755, and that they had nine children,
seven girls and two boys. The family moved from Connecticut to the
west branch of the Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania, and then to Chemung County,
N. Y. Three of the daughters married and went west. Benjamin, one of the
sons, who was the father of E. T.  Bentley, moved from Chemung County,
(Bentley’s Creek) to Tioga County, Pa., 1806, and resided there until his
death in 1854.

Since the foregoing was written I have received a letter under date of Dec. 11,
1896, from Bentley Worth of West Chester, Pa., in which he says: <q>I have
examined fully in the records of Chester County and find a George Bentley as
giving a mortgage on a farm of 144½ acres, in the Township of Newlin, for the
sum of £80, dated Nov. 9, 1758, recorded March 15, 1759 and not satisfied.
I cannot find any deed for the property, nor any sale of the same recorded,
as I wanted to see who his wife was. Elsewhere, however, I find her name was
Jane Carson. I find in the history of Chester County, that in 1747 a regiment
was formed in the time of the English and French war, and George Bentley was
appointed a lieutenant, but nothing further is mentioned of him. In the
history it appears that the Rev. Owen Thomas was the first Baptist minister
in Newlin Township. He preached at John Bentley’s house. After the death of
John he preached in the house of his son Jeffrey, who in 1752 gave a lot of
ground and built a meeting house, with small help from others. Jeffrey
Bentley, after the death of his father, was made deacon. After a
great revival the meeting house became too small, and being badly located a
new location was chosen where the Hephzibah Church now stands. In 1792 the
corner stone was laid. The location was selected by a committee, three of
whom were Jesse Bentley, Elizabeth Bentley, and Lydia Bentley. I find in
county records a will dated 1759, of Mary Bentley, widow of John Bentley.</q>
As to the relationship between John and George Bentley Mr. Worth has no
knowledge, but all the circumstances seem to indicate that they were
brothers, and sons of Wm. Bentley, Jr., of Rhode Island. Mr. Bentley Worth
says that so far as he knows there are now no Bentleys in Chester County.
Mr. Bentley Worth himself is a grandson of Mary Bentley, daughter of George,
and is now 77 years old, and has lived in Chester County all his life.

John D. Bentley was born in Rensselaer County, N. Y., near the Massachusetts
line, in 1840. Here his father Ray Bentley, who was a farmer, was born. Here
his grandfather Noah, the Baptist preacher, heretofore referred to, was born,
and lived, and died, and here his great‐grandfather Philip settled and built
the first grist and saw mill in the county. Tradition says he had a brother
who settled in Rhode Island, and if so Wm. Bentley, Sr., was the man, but
more likely I think, he was a nephew of Wm. Bentley, Sr. John D. Bentley
states that his grandfather Noah Bentley married for his second wife Dianah
Greene, in 1791. It will be noticed in note to page 6 that E. T. Bentley
states that HIS grandfather, Greene Bentley, married a Dianah Greene in
1755, all of which is evidence of Rhode Island kinship. John D. Bentley in
1864 married Julia Swetland, of Mayville, N. Y., and for a number of years
was a merchant in Vineland, N.J. About 1870 he removed to Corry, Pa., where
he still resides as a prosperous merchant. At the present time (1897) he is
a member of the House of Representatives of the Pennsylvania Legislature. He
has a family of four sons and a daughter.

Anson G. Bentley, second son of James and Temperance Bentley, was born Dec.
25, (Christmas) 1824, in Brookfield, Trumbull County, O. His early life was
spent on his father’s farm in summer and going to school in winter. As soon
as he was fitted for the profession, he engaged in teaching. In 1853 he
gathered together his possessions and started for the gold fields of
California locating in Nevada City. There he remained for five years and met
with satisfactory results. In 1858 he returned to his old home and soon
after settled in Youngstown, O. There he conducted a lumber business for one
year. He assisted in organizing the first National Bank of Youngstown and
for many years was vice‐president and one of the directors. He was also
interested in a flouring mill. In 1869 he came to Niles with two partners
and started the Bank of Wick, Bentley &amp; Co. This was afterwards converted
into a Banking Association of which Mr. Bentley was president. Ten years
afterwards this association was succeeded by A. G. Bentley &amp;
Company and three years later in 1883 this business was closed out. Since
that time Mr. Bentley has given his attention to real estate and other
business interests. He was united in marriage Aug. 5, 1858, to Miss Mary
Amelia Ingraham, daughter of Rev. S. W. Ingraham of the M. E. Church. Mr.
and Mrs. Bentley are the parents of four children, Anson J., Frank, Mary E.
(now Mrs. W. A. Thomas) and an infant that died at the age of two years.

<h2>Appendix.</h2>

<h3>Rhode Island Bentleys.</h3>

<p>From a chart issued some years ago by Joel Munsell’s Sons, genealogical
and local history publishers, of Albany, N. Y., we glean the only
information we have of the Bentley family in Rhode Island. From this chart
it appears that William Bentley, of Kingstown, R. I., signed the petition
heretofore referred to on page 4, on the 29th day of July, 1679. It is also
stated that his wife’s name was Sarah, and that he died in 1720.

<p>Thus far we have no Documentary Evidence or Distinct Traditions,
connecting these Rhode Island Bentleys with the New York and Pennsylvania
Bentleys, but the family names, dates of births, and all the surrounding
circumstances (or <i>res gestae</i> as the lawyers would say) indicate
their kinship. If anyone can prove the contrary, I would be glad to hear
from him. William Bentley had five children who are recorded in the Rhode
Island chart as follows:
